# vim-config
##about
This is my personal vim config with vim-plug
 ##instalation
 1. install vim-plug (i usualy copy the source into .vim/autoload/plug.vim bc my curl is bugged)
 2. clone the repo and replace `/.vimrc with the .vimrc in this repo
 3. install desired linters, ale will autodetect them
 4. launch vim and run the following commands: source %, PlugInstall
